# timesheet_update.py
Python project I created to update a timesheet, check if Microsoft outlook is open, and then open it if currently closed.
Code will then add email contents including attaching the timesheet file, adding TO and CC fields, and then adding the email body.

The code may be useful to others if they need a template which includes relevant code to update a certain cell in a spreadsheet as well as attach the information and add relevant fields to an email in outlook.

Outlook checker may be buggy - needs some work. Only tested on windows machine.
